# Greetings, Adventurer


We don't hunt monsters—we hunt bugs. 
With test-driven development as our silver sword and refactoring as our Aard, we slay technical debt and purify code. 
Like Geralt, we prepare for every battle: tests are our potions, and reviews are our signs. 
Remember, no one walks the path alone—pull requests welcome, and merge conflicts must fall.
